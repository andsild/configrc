Configuration files; pick as you please

# Current (active) setup:

## VIM
...

## WMII (Window / Tiling Manager)
There are no (silly) concepts of master windows or fixed window
rules.  Note that i3 is the successor and more actively maintained. I just like
wmii because I've spent time with it.

## Gentoo / Portage (Package Management)
I can't say that I recommend this for everyone, but its wonderful if you have
the time. Otherwise, check out http://www.sabayon.org/

## st (simple-terminal) + Screen
I hated st for not implementing scrolling. 
Then I realized multiplexers (screen) are quite awesome.

`<C-A>[` will enable copy mode. When you learn to master this, you don't have
to use the mouse to copy paste, and you can quite easily search command output.

## Zathura (PDF)
It has vim-bindings and color-invert

## Chrome (Mail/Websites)
I've tinkered with UZBL quite a bit. But chrome is easy. All websites work.
Synchronizing settings to computers and devices *so easy*.

| `cdm`       | A window manager (layman term: login manager). It doesn't use X (having a login without X is neat.) |
| `gimp`      | Heavy, but its nice knowing an image editor. |
| `ipython`   | use this as your calculator |
| `mitmproxy` | excellent web interceptor |
| `slock`     | lock your computer |
| `spotify`   | Woopwoop |
| `sxiv`      | view images (or use `chrome`) |
| `xset`      | To disable screensaver: `xset -dpms; xset s off`. Stop using `xdotool` :p |
| `xrandr`    | For connecting extra monitors and other. <br />`xrandr --auto LVDS1 --left-of VGA1`<br />is typical  usage (easily accessed with `<c-r>VGA` in a terminal. |
| `wpa_gui`   | Network-manager without too much hassle. |
| `workrave`  | prevent RSI and live healthily. Annoying as hell but a lifesaver. |
